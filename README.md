# PersonalTimeManager
A compact Windows personal time manager
---

"Have you already inserted your work hours in the system?"
"Did you complete your work hours this week?"

If you work in a PC and hear these questions before making up some data to complete a workload spreadsheet, Personal Time Manager is your answer.

## Features

- **Practical**: Automatic task recognition from active window title name
- **Non-invasive**: The current window title is all that is ever read
- **Flexible**: Adjust your own time distribution (in case work was done out of the PC, for example)
- **Precise**: Control tasks on the level of a second
- **Beginner-friendly**: Get notifications to help associate title substrings to tasks. Turn them off when not needed anymore
- **Easy to report**: Gather statistics on a daily and monthly basis
